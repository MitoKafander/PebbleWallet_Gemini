# App Store Publishing Plan

This document outlines the steps to publish GeminiWallet to the public Pebble ecosystem.

## 1. Store Selection
We will submit to the **Rebble Developer Portal** ([dev-portal.rebble.io](https://dev-portal.rebble.io/)).
- **Why:** This automatically puts the app in BOTH the Rebble store and the new Core Devices store.

## 2. Metadata Requirements
- **Name:** Gemini Wallet
- **Category:** Utilities
- **Release Notes (v1.2):** Clean initial release with Aztec, QR (full charset), and PDF417 support. Offline persistent storage and card reordering enabled.

## 3. Asset Checklist
- [ ] **Small Icon:** (25x25 PNG) - Current placeholder is `resources/images/menu_icon.png`. Needs real design.
- [ ] **Large Icon:** (80x80 PNG) - Needs design.
- [ ] **Screenshots:** Need to capture from emulator:
    - Main card list.
    - Card detail view (showing an Aztec code).
    - Card detail view (showing a QR code).

## 4. Next Session Actions
1.  Replace placeholder icon with a real design.
2.  Capture emulator screenshots.
3.  Upload `GeminiWallet.pbw` to the Rebble Portal.
